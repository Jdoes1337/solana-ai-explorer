# 🧪 Solana AI Explorer - Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Testing Options

### Option 1: Test Frontend Only (No Backend Required)
You can test the frontend interface immediately without any setup:

1. **Open the frontend file**:
   ```bash
   open client/index.html
   ```
   Or double-click `client/index.html` in Finder

2. **What you'll see**:
   - Beautiful interface with example queries
   - Input field for natural language queries
   - Example buttons to try different query types

3. **Limitations**:
   - Queries won't work (no backend)
   - But you can see the UI and test the interface

### Option 2: Test with Mock Data (Recommended)
I'll create a mock version that simulates the backend responses:

1. **Open the mock version**:
   ```bash
   open client/index-mock.html
   ```

2. **What you'll get**:
   - Full interface experience
   - Simulated responses to queries
   - No backend required
   - See how the app will work

### Option 3: Full Local Testing (Complete Setup)
If you want to test the complete application:

1. **Install Node.js** (from nodejs.org)
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Set up services** (PostgreSQL, Redis)
4. **Run the application**: `npm run dev`

## 🎯 Recommended Testing Path
